# WordPress Backup Tool for WP Engine

A lightweight shell script tool to create WordPress content backups via SSH. This tool connects to your WordPress server, creates a zip backup of important files and folders, and downloads it to your local machine with a date-based filename.

## Features

- üîê SSH connection with key or password authentication
- üì¶ Automated zip backup creation
- üìÅ Backs up wp-content/uploads, themes, plugins, and wp-config.php
- üìÖ Date-based filename pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD.wp-content.zip`
- üè† Downloads backup to your home directory
- üßπ Automatic cleanup of remote backup files
- üöÄ Lightweight shell script implementation

## Requirements

- SSH client
- SCP client
- zip/unzip utilities
- Bash shell

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nelsonmiew/tool-wp-engine-wordpress-backup.git
cd tool-wp-engine-wordpress-backup
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

### Required Variables:
- `SSH_USER`: SSH username for the remote server
- `SSH_HOST`: SSH hostname or IP address
- `SSH_PATH`: Path to WordPress installation on remote server

### Optional Variables:
- `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY`: SSH private key content (if not set, will use password auth)
- `SSH_MYSQL_PATH`: MySQL path (for future database backup features)
- `backup_include_only_folders`: Comma-separated list of folders within wp-content to backup (default: "uploads,languages")

### Example:
```bash
export SSH_USER="your-username"
export SSH_HOST="your-server.com"
export SSH_PATH="/var/www/html/wordpress"
export SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)"
export backup_include_only_folders="uploads,languages"
```

## Usage

Run the backup script:
```bash
./backup.sh
```

## What Gets Backed Up

The tool creates a zip file containing:
- Folders specified in `backup_include_only_folders` (default: uploads, languages)
  - `wp-content/uploads/` - All uploaded media files (default)
  - `wp-content/languages/` - WordPress language files (default)
- `wp-config.php` - WordPress configuration file

**Excluded from backup:**
- `wp-content/cache/` - Cache files
- `wp-content/tmp/` - Temporary files

You can customize which folders to backup by setting the `backup_include_only_folders` environment variable:
```bash
export backup_include_only_folders="uploads,themes,plugins"
```

## Output

The backup file will be saved to your home directory with the format:
```
~/YYYY-MM-DD.wp-content.zip
```

For example: `~/2024-01-15.wp-content.zip`

## Security Notes

- SSH private keys are handled securely and cleaned up after use
- The tool uses standard SSH/SCP commands for secure connections
- Remote backup files are automatically deleted after download
- No credentials are stored permanently

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Errors
If you encounter permission errors, ensure your SSH user has read access to the WordPress directory and write access to create zip files.

### Connection Issues
- Verify SSH credentials and server accessibility
- Check that SSH service is running on the target server
- Ensure firewall allows SSH connections

### Missing Files in Backup
Some files may be skipped due to permissions. The tool will continue and report warnings for any inaccessible files.
